<article> I have been playing chess since 7 years old. I have got some significant achievements in both Cyprus and Turkey. I also play the piano and I have accomplished grade 5 in ABRSM exams. I hope to continue in the future. I enjoy reading books. The last book I have read was The Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare. My coding adventure began with my curiosity of artificial intelligence. I have realised that in order to be able to understand artificial intelligence, I have to learn coding.</article>
